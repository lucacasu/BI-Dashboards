# Business Intelligence Dashboards
**Dashboards leveraging open source data.**
 <br>
 <br>

**Tool:** Looker Studio / Google Analytics <br>
**Language:** SQL <br>
**Data:** Sourced from Google Merchandise Store. <br>
**Link:** https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/9e6bc7f0-0b00-44dd-9754-31a5d1aa41c9

This dashboard explores revenue sources, key store items and paid traffic performance. The user gets a snapshot of moth-to-date revenue figures with quarterly benchmark, followed by a custom-made brand and item breakdown, which was extracted in Looker from the product name field. The main store events (views, add-to-cart and purchases) are displayed by week, alonside the respective figures. The paid traffic summary shows all active campaigns ordered and colored by ROAS (Return on Ad Spending).
